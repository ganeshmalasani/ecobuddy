Secure each layer with strong adhesive or other suitable method.</li>\n  <li><b>Create the central structure:</b>  Construct a sturdy framework to support the weight of the assembled bottles.  This could involve using wire, metal rods or another durable material.</li>\n  <li><b>Attach the bottle layers:</b> Securely attach the prepared bottle layers to the central structure, maintaining a balanced and aesthetically pleasing design.</li>\n  <li><b>Install lighting:</b> Integrate small light sources (LEDs are recommended for energy efficiency) within the bottle structures. Consider using battery-powered LEDs for ease of placement.</li>\n  <li><b>Add decorative elements (optional):</b> Use the paper labels to create decorative accents, such as a band around the mid-section of the chandelier.</li>\n  <li><b>Finish and hang:</b> Once the chandelier is assembled, attach a hanging mechanism to the top of the central structure. Ensure the fixture is securely hung and stable.</li>\n</ol>\n\n```",
