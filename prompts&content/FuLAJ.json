The top tier will require a different cut to accommodate light bulbs.</li>\n    <li><b>Assemble the tiers:</b> Arrange the cut bottles in rows to form tiers of decreasing size for a tiered effect.  Secure each tier with strong adhesive or wire.</li>\n    <li><b>Add bottle caps:</b> Use the plastic bottle caps as decorative accents between tiers, gluing them around the circumference of each tier. Consider painting them a metallic color for a more polished look.</li>\n    <li><b>Attach lights:</b> Carefully insert LED or small light bulbs into the modified top tier water bottles.</li>\n    <li><b>Create the frame:</b> Construct a frame from wire or metal rods to support the tiers, ensuring a stable and visually appealing structure. This frame will hold the tiers and allow for hanging.</li>\n    <li><b>Attach paper labels:</b> Cut the paper labels into strips and use these to decorate the plastic bottles for a customized design.</li>\n    <li><b>Hang and illuminate:</b> Once complete, suspend the chandelier from the ceiling and enjoy your upcycled masterpiece!</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p><b>Materials:</b></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Plastic water bottles</li>\n    <li>Plastic bottle caps</li>\n    <li>Paper labels</li>\n    <li>Strong adhesive/wire</li>\n    <li>LED lights</li>\n    <li>Metal rods/wire for the frame</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>\n```",
