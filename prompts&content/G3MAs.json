This may involve removing the bottom portion of some bottles.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Attach the cut bottle pieces together using strong adhesive, creating a frame that mimics the shape of a chandelier.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Attach the plastic bottle caps to the bottle pieces, if needed to secure joints or add design elements.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Wrap the paper labels around the bottles or cut and attach sections to decorate and cover some areas of the structure.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Attach a pre-existing chandelier chain or create one from additional recycled materials (not provided in the list) to hang the structure.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n```",
