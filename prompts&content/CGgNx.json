    "Image Generation Prompt": "A cozy, eclectic living room filled with upcycled furniture and decor. A cardboard coffee table assembled from flattened boxes, a lampshade made from a repurposed phone book, and a vertical garden built with plastic bottles. Soft lighting illuminates the space, highlighting textured throw pillows made from old clothing and a rug woven from plastic bags. The overall ambiance is warm, inviting, and sustainable, demonstrating the beauty of repurposing everyday items.",
    "Steps": "Here's how to create a coffee table similar to the one in the image using the provided materials:\n\n**1.  Base Construction:**\n\n* **Material:** Cardboard boxes (multiple).  The larger the boxes, the sturdier and larger the final table.  Ideally, you'd want boxes of similar size and shape for a cleaner look.  You might want to use more boxes than less for strength.\n* **Method:**  Arrange the cardboard boxes to form a rectangular base of your desired size and height.  Use strong tape (packing tape is best) to securely attach the boxes to one another, creating a solid, stable structure.  If necessary, reinforce the corners with extra layers of cardboard or tape for extra durability.  Consider laying the boxes horizontally for additional stability, making sure the base is even.\n\n\n**2.  Top Creation:**\n\n* **Material:** Cardboard boxes (likely 2 large ones) and cardboard from the milk carton, phone book, or other sources for extra support or patching if needed.\n* **Method:**  Create a tabletop from cardboard boxes. You'll likely need to cut the boxes to fit the dimensions of your base.  Again, securely tape them together, ensuring a smooth surface as much as possible. For additional strength, you might use layers of cardboard. Any gaps or inconsistencies can be filled with cut pieces of cardboard.\n\n\n**3. Finishing (Optional but Recommended):**\n\n* **Material:**  Aluminum foil (or sturdy wrapping paper).\n* **Method:**  Cover the entire coffee table, base, and top with aluminum foil.  This will give a more polished, and less cardboardy look.  Use tape to secure the foil to the edges. This will make the table more resistant to spills and damage.  You could also paint the boxes before covering them with foil or paper.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Sturdiness:**  The success of this project hinges on building a strong base. Use plenty of tape to reinforce all joints.  This table isn't meant for heavy use; it's best suited for lighter items.\n* **Aesthetics:** While the materials are rustic, try to make it as neat as possible. Straight lines and even surfaces will make the end result look much better.\n* **Size:** Determine the desired size and height of your coffee table before you start.\n\n\nThe other materials are not really suitable for constructing this particular type of coffee table.  They might be used for other DIY projects, but not to replace the function of the cardboard boxes here.\n",
