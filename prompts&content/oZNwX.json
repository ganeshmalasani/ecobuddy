Consider the size and placement of walls, windows, doors, and battlements.</li>\n  <li><b>Cut the Walls:</b> Carefully cut the cardboard according to your design, creating the castle's walls and roof.  Be mindful of the box's pre-existing folds and flaps.</li>\n  <li><b>Create Battlements:</b> Cut out rectangular sections along the top edge of the walls to form the battlements. You might need to fold and score the cardboard to make them stand up. </li>\n  <li><b>Cut the Door & Windows:</b> Cut out arched or rectangular openings for the doors and windows.</li>\n  <li><b>Optional: Additional Features:</b> Add details like a drawbridge (from a cardboard flap) or a small tower (from a separate box piece).</li>\n  <li><b>Reinforce the Structure (optional):</b> To make your castle more durable, you can add extra layers of cardboard for reinforcement in key areas, especially around cutouts or corners.</li>\n  <li><b>Decorate (optional):</b> Once your castle structure is complete, you can decorate it using markers, crayons, paint, or other materials.  Consider adding a moat around the base using a separate cardboard strip</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Safety Note:</h2>\n<p>Adult supervision is required when using sharp cutting tools.  Always cut away from yourself and use a cutting mat to protect surfaces.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n",
